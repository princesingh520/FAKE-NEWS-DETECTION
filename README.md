# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
Problem Statement

Build a classification model to detect fake news articles based on textual content. :Apply NLP techniques to real-world problems involving text classification and misinformation detection

Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as "real" or "fake" using two datasets: fake.csv (containing fake news articles) and true.csv (containing genuine news articles). The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to address the growing challenge of misinformation in digital media.

Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. Libraries: Importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

2. Loading Dataset: Loading the datasets containing fake and true news articles.

3. Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the datasets to understand their structure and content.

4. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis, including label assignment.

5. Model Training: Training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to classify news articles.

6. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy and classification reports.
