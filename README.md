# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
#Problem Statement

Build a classification model to detect fake news articles based on textual content. :Apply NLP techniques to real-world problems involving text classification and misinformation detection

#Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as "real" or "fake" using two datasets: fake.csv (containing fake news articles) and true.csv (containing genuine news articles). The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to address the growing challenge of misinformation in digital media.

#Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. <u>Libraries: Importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

2. <u>Loading Dataset: Loading the datasets containing fake and true news articles.

3. <u>Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the datasets to understand their structure and content.

4. <u>Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis, including label assignment.

5. <u>Model Training: Training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to classify news articles.

6. <u>Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy and classification reports.
